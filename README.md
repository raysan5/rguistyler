## rGuiStyler Usage

The tool is pretty intuitive and easy-to-use, just choose the control to edit, the property to edit and select a value for that property (color, number...). Changes are previewed in real time in the same tool! 

Once a style has been created, just save it as a **text style file (.rgs)** file or export a **controls table image (.png)** for preview and easy distribution.

rGuiStyler ONE also allows exporting style as binary style file (.rgs) and a portable code file (.h) to easily embedd and load style from your code, including embedded fonts.

**rGuiStyler ONE** comes with a powerful command line for style format conversion and edition. To view all available operation just run on command line:

 > rguistyler.exe --help
